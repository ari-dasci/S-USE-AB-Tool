# An online A/B testing Decision Support System for web usability assessment

This project provides a method for the automatic application of the Multi Expert Multi Criteria Linguistic Decision-Making model for US Evaluation (LDM4USE).
Building on the widely recognized System Usability Scale (SUS), we fuse collective opinions to provide results regarding the usability of each of the websites in an understandable way. Our proposal is implemented as an A/B testing tool called **USE-AB-test DSS**, and we have use it to describe a case use for the assessment of three Moodle platforms of the University of Guadalajara, Mexico. This heavy and data-intensive task has been greatly simplified with the support of the software.
