### Moodle Case Use 
We propose to test one of the most popular Learning Management System (LMS), the one known as Moodle.
To demonstrate the usefulness of LDM4USE proposal, we have set the same MOOC course into different Moodle platforms present in different real university centers at the University of Guadalajara, Mexico.

Alternatives are:
1. [University of Guadalajara Tonal√° Center Moodle platform] (https://moodle2.cutonala.udg.mx/course/view.php?id=1605) (in sort, **CUTonala**)
2. [University of Guadalajara Northern University Center Virtual Campus] (https://pregrados.cunorte.udg.mx/course/view.php?id=6687) (in sort, **CUNorte**)
3. [University of Guadalajara Center of Los Lagos Moodle platform] (https://plataforma.lagos.udg.mx/course/view.php?id=2278) (noted, **CULagos**).

Decision makers are:  4 UX experts and 11 end-users, each one under selected roles.

Role-playing selected: *Blind*, *Ear infection*, *Arm injury* 

Criteria used:
1. Moodle Usability Test with 28 tasks 
2. SUS Questionnaire
3. NPS question
4. Accesiblity chek with WaveTool

Assesments for each alternative:
1. Usability Test with 28 tasks x 15 users = 420 linguistic assesments of satisfaction, plus 420 time expended per task, plus success or failure on the task.
2. SUS Questionnaire: 10 responses x 15 users, computes 15 SUS values 
3. NPS question: 15 responses, computes 15 SUS values 
4. Accesiblity chek with WaveTool x 4 expert users

Total project asesments = 1429 * 3 = 4298
The previous are inputs of our LDM4USE model. Under a Computing with Words scheme, our tool computes this final report
